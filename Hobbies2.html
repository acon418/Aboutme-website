       <p>My family and I visited 12 different countries during the two years we were living in Europe, and it was an incredible opportunity to learn about the many cultures, distinctive architectural styles, delicacies, and other aspects of these nations. I'll list my top five favorite places I've traveled to on this page, along with my recommendations for traveling there with or without your family. You can access the World Travel Guide by clicking on any of the links for each nation listed below. Selecting a destination for your family to visit from the World Travel Guide is a fairly simple process. I sincerely hope you and your family will find this to be very useful.</p>
