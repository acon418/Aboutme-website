      <p>Since moving to Germany, I've wanted to learn German, and now that I'm in a class, I understand and can say the basics. My high school German teacher, Ms. Detlif, is a fantastic teacher who excels at involving students like myself in learning and making it enjoyable. She showed us the <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/learn"> Duolingo </a> website. Duolingo is ideal for anyone interested in learning languages from around the world. This app is accessible such as through a mobile phone or laptop, is simple to use, and allows you to learn more than one language at the same time! I swear I'm not promoting LMAO, but you should check it out because she really put me on. </p>
