	    <p>Here, I'll outline my exercise routine. On each of the five days of the week that I train, I do pull, push, legs, cardio, and full body exercises. You are under no obligation to use my fitness plan; it is entirely optional. Do whatever it takes to achieve your goal.</p>

		     <li><h2>Wednesday: Cardio</h2></li>
		     <p>If you have access to a gym, I would suggest using the treadmill for two hours of running or a good, moderate pace on the bike. If you don't have time to go to the gym, spend two hours running outside (MUST HAVE APPROPEAT RUNNING SHOES). Stretch for 20 minutes after you've run.</p>

		         <p>This is totally optional! You can choose your top 6 or 7 exercises on your full body day, every now and then you can switch it up if you like. It's all about your personal preference and the goals that you're trying to accomplish at the gym or at home.</p>
		    </ol>
		    <br>
		    <li><h2>Friday/Saturday: Rest Day</h2></li>
		    <p>Stretching helps me relax any tension or soreness from the previous night's sleep, therefore I usually like to do it first thing in the morning on my rest days. Additionally, it aids in boosting blood circulation and gets your body ready for the day. You can avoid waking up in additional agony by stretching your muscles before bed.</p>

		   <h2>REST PERIODS</h2>
		   <P>No more than 3-5min between different exercises, no more than 20 seconds between "REST-PAUSE" sets, and no more than 10 seconds between drop sets.</P>
		   
		   <h2>WORKOUT DURATION</h2>
		   <P>Try to be out of the gym as quickly as possible, to increase your work capacity and room for maximum recovery. so no more than 60-130min per session.</P>
